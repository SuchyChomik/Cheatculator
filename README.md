# Cheatculator
A modification for a calculator allowing you to cheat on exams. It features an OLED display, on which you can
display any black and white image (eg. chemistry or math formulas) with a press of a button.
## How it works / How to use
It works by connecting to a mobile hotspot that you set up before your exam.  
You visit a website on a phone or computer and upload all the images you want to display 
on the calculator. There is a capacitive touch sensor at the back of the device - you press 
it to cycle through the images.
